# Final Project

Autors: Tiago CÃ©sar Busata & Vitor Pohlenz

## Objective: Finding Donors for Charity

## Type: Supervised Classifiction Task

## Coclusions:
- As seem in notebook, the scores in training set and test set are quite close and greater than 50% (Naive estimation). 

- It means that we do not have problems as underfitting or overfitting here.

- And also comparing the results with other references like [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/classification-project-finding-donors-853db66fbb8c) and [here](https://github.com/lmego/finding_donors/blob/master/finding_donors.ipynb), this approach have a good enough (maybe a little better) result.  

- The results from idea of Monte Carlo Method just reinforce this conclusion.

Best Regards, Tiago and Vitor!
